# fastapi-beginner-projects

### Project Overview

 This project demonstrates the creation of a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API using FastAPI with Python. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

### Key Features:

CRUD Operations: Implement basic CRUD operations for managing data, providing endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources.

Asynchronous Capabilities: Utilize FastAPI's asynchronous features to build highly performant and scalable applications.

Pydantic Models: Leverage Pydantic for data validation and serialization, ensuring that all inputs and outputs conform to the defined data schemas.

Database Integration: The project includes examples of how to connect FastAPI with databases (such as SQLite or MySQL) using SQLAlchemy or another ORM, showcasing how to persist data.

Dependency Injection: FastAPI’s powerful dependency injection system is demonstrated to manage authentication, authorization, and database sessions.

Interactive API Documentation: Automatically generate interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc, making it easier to test and explore the API endpoints.

Error Handling: Implement custom error handling for robust and user-friendly API responses.

### Learning Objectives:

Understand the basics of building RESTful APIs using FastAPI.

Get hands-on experience with Python’s type annotations and how they integrate with FastAPI.

Learn to manage data validation and serialization using Pydantic models.

Explore database interactions using an ORM in the context of a FastAPI application.

Gain insights into implementing asynchronous programming in a web framework.

### Getting Started:

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the FastAPI application, including dependencies, environment setup, and running the application locally.
